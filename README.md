Apex is a advanced webOS environment powered by Solid.js and an x86 Linux subsystem. Configure your environment to be your own with custom apps, themes, workspaces, and more.

Using interception proxies and Wisp-powered networking, Apex can connect to the world and function as an isolated workspace, separate from your main system, all running inside your browser.

Apex features a fully-functioning window management system, app library, system tray, menu bar - everything that you would need out of a complete OS environment.
